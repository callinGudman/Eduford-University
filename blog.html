				<h2>Our Certificate & Online Programs For 2021</h2>
				<p> Many businesses are prioritizing the adoption of cloud computing solutions in an effort to streamline their
					operations, better support their customers and remain agile in an ever-changing world. As organizations
					migrate resources to the cloud,  IT professionals with strong technical knowledge to help implement these
					cloud-based solutions will become a critical component to their future success. This cloud computing
					certificate was designed to help you build the technical knowledge and skills you need.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>DeVry’s online Cloud Computing certificate helps prepare you with the skills needed to build a career in
					Cloud Computing. This program is designed to help you learn cloud computing skills needed to help improve
					business productivity by learning how to design, deploy and manage cloud solutions.
					As part of this undergraduate cloud computing certificate, you will be equipped with DeVry’s
					Internet of Things (IoT) Kit1, which provides hands-on learning to help you develop the skills needed
					for today’s IoT economy.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>Prepare for a number of industry-recognized tech certifications through earning a Networking Essentials
					Undergraduate Certificate. DeVry’s program can help prepare you to sit for the CompTIA Linux+, CompTIA
					NETWORK+, CompTIA Cloud+ and CCNA certifications and pursue a career in information technology.
					This online computer networking certificate can help get you started by teaching you how organizations and
					businesses are networked and exchange secured information. Plus, gain hands-on experience with
					Internet of Things (IoT) technologies through DeVry’s IoT Kit1.

				</p>
				<br>
				<p>Make the most of earning a Networking Essentials Certificate from DeVry by applying qualifying credits
					toward a specific associate or bachelor’s degree program at DeVry. For example, by applying qualifying
					certificate credits to a particular associate degree program at DeVry, you are already 40% of the way toward
					earning that credential, and 20% of the way to a bachelor’s degree. It can be a great way to save both
					time and money in furthering your education.
